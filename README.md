# lightcontrol
nodejs project that lets you create rules in a mysql/mariadb and gives you control over a PCF8591 DAC via I2C to control dimmable light tubes. Roughly speaking. :-)

Preferably using a RaspberryPI or similar.

This is still under heavy development, but all technical details and hardware was already tested and is working.

Feel free to contact me for details.


Installation steps

optional	activate ssh
			activate i2c
			install mysql
			install apache
			install nodejs
